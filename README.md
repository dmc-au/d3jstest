# Learning D3.js 
https://d3js.org

## Intro
D3.js is a general purpose library that helps
to manipulate the DOM with relation to data.

The following examples show to perform some basic operations in d3.js.
Code is commented as much as is practical in the process.

## Examples 1 and 2
```index.html``` and ```app.js``` host the first two examples
as shown in this YouTube tutorial: www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOJ9yjvlapY

E.g. 1 shows how to generate html paragraphs based on dummy data.
E.g. 2 shows how to generate a simple (but not scaled) bar chart
based on the same dummy data.

## Example 3
```index2.html``` and ```app2.js``` host the third (of three) examples
from the YouTube tutorial listed above.

E.g. 3 shows how to generate a bar chart using the svg element, scale the
elements, and add a timing component to elements.
